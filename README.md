# CropWaterStressSensor
This is a sensor that runs the crop water stress index (CWSI) based on images of a thermal camera and communicates the results via a screen.

The Crop Water Stress Sensor measures and visualizes the drought stress that usually affects plants during a dry period and logs the results to an SD card. 

Due to climate change, droughts and dry periods will become more frequent. The consequences of a drought are often a reduction or failure of the yield and a general decrease of the yield quality. It is therefore high time to make people aware of the problem, collect data and develop more resilient agricultural systems. 

The Crop Water Stress Sensor is designed to intuitively show the often non-obvious water stress of our crops while collecting valuable time series data on an SD card. Using a low-cost thermal imaging camera (MLX90640), plant surface temperatures are recorded and the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) is calculated. The results of the CWSI are shown on the display as current measurement, daily average, 14-day retrospective and 5-day trend and on a “traffic light” that indicates plant stress.
